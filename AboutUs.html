            <section id="statistics">
               <p>More than sixty percent of students at Virginia Tech receive financial aid each year (with seven thousand dollars as the average amount of aid received per year). This financial aid often goes straight towards school expenses such as tuition and textbooks leaving no extra funding for food and other supplies.</p>

                <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>Located inside the <a href="http://www.vtwesley.com/" target="blank">Wesley Foundation</a> at 209 W. Roanoke St., 209 Manna Ministries is a pantry that provides food, toiletries, and school supplies for college students and their families. Anyone who feels as if they are lacking food and necessities may apply to shop at 209 Manna Ministries. Shopping is based on a point system in which each good is worth a certain amount of points, ranging from 1 to 6 points, and each shopper is allowed 50 points to shop with each week.</p>
                    <p>We have just began a partnership with the NLCF community as we begin to expand the pantry to include more refrigerated items. We encourage other organizations to do the same, to offer more hours for the pantry to be open serving students.</p>
                    <p>Store hours are currently every  Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday evening from 4:00 pm to 6:30 pm. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:209MannaVT@gmail.com">209MannaVT@gmail.com</a> with any questions or concerns or to make an appointment.</p>
