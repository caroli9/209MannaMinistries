                <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>More than sixty percent of students at Virginia Tech receive financial aid each year (with seven                            thousand dollars as the average amount of aid received per year). This financial aid often goes                              straight towards school expenses such as tuition and textbooks leaving no extra funding for food and                        other supplies.</p>
                    <p>The mission of 209 Manna Ministries is to provide food, toiletries, and school supplies for college                          students at Virginia Tech. Customers will be welcomed by open hearts, open minds, open arms, and open                        doors. Confidentiality is important to 209 Manna Ministries, and applicant information will never be                        disclosed without permission.</p>
